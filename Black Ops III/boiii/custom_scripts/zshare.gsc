    ZSHARE T7 v1.0  --  Weapon sharing for Black Ops III Zombies

    by Xep

======================================================================

    A port of ZShare (Plutonium T6) to Black Ops III. A fork of the T6
    build rather than the older two: this engine has the same unitrigger
    system, the same box states, the same validation hooks and the same
    perk limit hook, so what a player does is identical.

        Weapons   Look at a teammate and press use. They see the gun in
                  your hands, look back at you and press use, and the
                  two weapons change hands -- ammo, attachments, camo
                  and the Alternate Ammo Type with them.
        Points    Crouch first, then use: 1000 points go across.
        Box hits  Paid for a box weapon you do not want? Crouch and
                  press use at the box, and it is anyone's to take. The
                  same at the Pack-a-Punch.
        Paying    Crouch and press use at a perk machine, or at the box
                  or the Pack-a-Punch while nobody is using it, and the
                  next teammate to use that machine pays nothing.

    Everything runs on the host. Nobody else needs this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE T6 BUILD

    One rule shapes this port: **hooks and displacement, never detour.**
    Black Ops III has four ways to run a script -- the injected route,
    BOIII, T7x and the Steam Workshop -- and only two of them can replace
    a stock function at all. A port built on detours would be a different
    mod on each route, so ZShare uses what every route has:

      Hooks the game already offers. level.custom_perk_validation before
      a drink, level.pack_a_punch.custom_validation before a pack,
      level.get_player_perk_purchase_limit for the limit, and the magic
      box's own unitrigger stub for the press.

      Displacement for the two loops T6 replaces. A stock loop that ends
      older copies of itself with a notify can be ended from outside, and
      ZShare's copy of it started in the same frame. The Pack-a-Punch
      trigger loop ends on "pack_a_punch_trigger_think"; the perk loops
      end on "death".

    The chat word is the other difference. Black Ops III raises its chat
    notify on the player who typed rather than on the level, so the
    listener is per player.

    And the words themselves. Every line a player reads goes by key --
    zs_say( "MSG_GAVE", to, amount ) -- through the TEXT block at the
    bottom, which is generated from zshare-text.json. The loose builds
    carry it in English; the Workshop build carries the same keys over
    localized strings, so each player reads their own language.

    docs/porting-t7.md in the project has the detail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VERIFICATION

    gsc-tool answers "not implemented" for both Black Ops III dialects,
    so this gets the T5 and T4 treatment: every call, field, notify and
    flag is checked against the stock script dump. See audit.py and
    deep_check.py. The t7-compiler is a real compiler, so the injected
    build is rejected at build time if the script is bad.

    ENTRY POINT

    Black Ops III registers a script with the system manager and hangs
    its work off the shared callbacks, rather than exposing an init()
    the loader happens to call. The typo in the autoexec's name is the
    game's own.

        otherwise still fire and could win the self.zs_thinking race.
        Nothing would misbehave, since both are the same code, but the
        level would be set up by one copy and the player watchers by the

    everybody and hands the weapon to whoever presses; after the hacker
    summons one, auto_open and no_charge open it for the next player

    the other two, and the box does the rest of the work itself.

    relay, so ZShare sees a press before the chest does -- and the stock
